# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?



2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Some similarities is the uses of varianbles and also the uses of methods. Some differences are the way in which we declare these variables. I was used to having to state the data type such as String, int, etc. Now, that is no longer needed.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
One really cool thing that was brand new to me was the slicing method when we used it on lists. I also learned about asserts which I didn't know where a think even though I had technically been using them before in Java when checking my code.
